# Annual Review of Catalog Websites

## Background

we do annual reviews of websites with a lot of resources that can't be updated/evaluated by a script/recipe we have because unhelpful apis or none

## How to Complete an Annual Review
Use the GitHub issue to track your progress and record your results. 

1. Visit the Geoportal resource page for the parent website that you're reviewing. Use the blue **Visit Source** button under **Links** in the right sidebar to open the source site in a new tab or window. 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the resource page, and under **Has part...**, click **Browse all [number] records**. This will open a search for **Is Part Of > *resource ID***.
3. Compare the total number of datasets in this search with the total number of GIS datasets available on the parent website. In the Github issue 
4. 
5. In the **Is Part Of** search results, open the first record in a new tab or window. In a comment on the GitHub issue or notes elsewhere, start a numbered list, and put the link/title of this resource as the first item in the list. 
6. Check to see if a resource with the same name is present on the source cite. This could be in the main list of resources, or you may need to search the site. Every source cite is organized slightly differently. Note "resource present on source site" or "resource not present on source site" in the comment.
7. check links in description of geoportal page, if any, and note broken links
8. Make an attempt to find resource elsewhere and if you find that it's been moved, note new location
9. Label this numbered list item in the comment as **NO CHANGE**, **NEEDS CHANGE**, or **REMOVED**.
10. Repeat steps 5-9 for each resource in the **Is Part Of** search results.
10. Check main page of source site and any additional locations you've found for GIS resources that aren't part of the catalog in the geoportal. Make a list of **ADDED** resources. 

- we can spot check instead of checking every record if there are more than a certain total number
